/**
This project contains a simple driver to communicate with out Acoustophoretic board (our PAT).
This provides direct control over each transducer’s phase and amplitude, as well as access to
our MATD mode (high speed computation of single levitation traps, with amplitude and illumination control).
The module is encapsulated into a DLL, which you can use through interfaces in either C++ or C. 
This namespace contains a pure virtual interface (AsierInhoBoard), which cleints can use to control the boards.
It also contains an abstract factory, to allow creation of board controllers (AsierInhoBoards)
without exposing implementation details; as well as other utility functions for the DLL to print
notification, warning and error messages.
